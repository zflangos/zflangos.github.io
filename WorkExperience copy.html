<p>During this past summer, I took up a position working as an intern for a commercial real estate company known as Jones Lang Lasalle. I worked in their New York City office for almost four months, and enjoyed every second of it. I worked within the research department doing data analytics under my manager, who was the Senior Data Analyst of the company. I got to utilize my skill set in a professional environment and learn from some of the best leaders of the industry. One of my favorite projects I worked on there was a foot traffic analysis of the Hudson Yards submarket. I received a database of over 50,000 lines of information, and utilized python to make inferences on the data. The coolest part of this project was that I created a heat map that showed the density of foot traffic throughout the different areas within the submarket. My manager's manager was extremely impressed with my abilities.</p>

<p>Before my summer at JLL, I was exposed to the real estate industry through a residential company based in New York known as Compass. Here I worked on a small team of brokers to conduct comparative research on new developments that were popping up throughout the city. My team owned a property known as "Gramercy Gates", which was a multi-million dollar condo complex located in Gramercy. My job was to find buildings that had similar traits to this one, so that we can market our building more accurately to individuals that were interested in it. I used excel a lot during this internship, because I had a great amount of data that I needed to keep organized. I also created presentation decks for my team of brokers to present to others in the company, mainly for progress updates of where we were within the process. </p>

<p>Over the summer going into my junior year of college, I had to opportunity to work as the head diving instructor for a country club close to my house. I had the ability to train 14 divers, ranging from the ages of 6 all the way up to 15. Each day I would host practice for an hour, and on the weekends we would go to different clubs to compete against them in meets. At the end of the summer, we had counties and conferences, which were events were all the clubs competed together in a big tournament. One of my 12 year old divers was extremely gifted, and won first place within his age group. Not only did he win first in his age group, he won third place against a group of 15 year old boys. I couldn't have asked for a better job opportunity, being able to sit by the pool in the summer heat was unbeatable.</p>
