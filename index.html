<h3>Hello! My name is Zach Flangos, welcome to my website!</h3> 
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I grew up in a small town outside of New York City known as Bronxville. For college, I always knew I wanted to go to a bigger school. As soon as I visited the Unviersity of Wisconsin-Madison, I absolutely fell in love with it. After being at Wisconsin for 4 years, I can say that I surely made the right choice. Although I absolutely love the city of New York, I have made the choice to move to Chicago after graduation. I will be working in the Real Estate industry as a Valuations Analyst for a small firm known as Partner Valuation Advisors. I am excited to see where my journey leads me within my future endeavors, and could not have asked for a better outcome so far! </p>
<h2>Things To Know About Me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I have a huge passion for music. My great grandmother taught me how to play piano when I was 2 years old. I continued to take lessons up until the age of 12. In middle school, I chose to take up the violin in my orchestra class and thoroughly enjoyed it. Ever since middle school, I have been interested in musical production, using softwares such as Garageband and Logic Pro X. In college, I began to learn how to mix certain types of music using a DJ mixing board. My favorite genres include 90's hip hop, EDM music, and 2000's alternative rock.</li>
	<li>Ever since the age of 4, I really enjoyed the sport of Diving. My brother and I competed on a junior olympic level for a majority of our lives. In the summer I would dive for my local country club, and all year round, I would dive for my local club team located in Purchase, NY. I have been to several national events, even winning first place a few times. In high school, I was able to compete in our state tournament, which is an event with the best divers from NY district schools. </li>
	<li>For my second semester of my junior year in college, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Barcelona, Spain. I absolutely loved the way of life in Barcelona, and the people there were extremely kind and friendly. I lived a couple blocks away from the famous Sagrada Familia Cathedral, and had the opportunity to pass it on my walk to class each day. My favorite spanish cuisine had to be "paella", which is a rice dish mixed with different types of vegetables and seafood. One day, I hope to be able to work in Madrid or Barcelona for a year or so.</li>
